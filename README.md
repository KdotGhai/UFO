# UFO
Module 11 Javascript

### Overview
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project, we will construct an HTML page that pulls data from a javascript data file with the intent of creating a userinterface to filter the data by Key values from the data file. The HTML webpage should have a functioning interface with a user-friendly design to search for UFO sightings upon any inputs and update the data table.

### Results
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We helped our client Dana in constructing an HTML page and provided a header and a short blurb about the existence of UFOs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the website, you can observe the data from the original javascript data file on the right side. We added filters to sort through the data using date, city, state, country and UFO shape. You can type in your parameters into the filter and press enter at which point you will be able to see when/what city/state/country/shape/duration of the sighting and additional comments UFOs have been spotted. For example, these are all the sightings from the data set from the state of New York.

### Summary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this project, we created an aesthetically pleasing visual to present the data that was given to us. One of the drawbacks of this webpage is that the filters are very specific and thus the input must be exactly what is listed in the data. One way to overcome this could be to provide a drop-down menu on the filters so that this issue can be avoided and all the cities that UFO sightings occurred can be visualized in a simpler manner. Because of the very many cities that are listed, it would be easier still to filter by desired state and then have the cities filtered by state. Another way to organize the data would be to add a filter by duration of the UFO sighting, since it is a data point that is provided in the descriptions of the data set. While more data would make this website even more informative, there should also be some consideration as to what does and does not actually qualify as a UFO sighting, so some verification process should be implemented to discern whether a person actually saw a UFO.
